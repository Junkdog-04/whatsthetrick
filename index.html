      <ul class="truths">
        <li>
          <strong>Trick noun [c]</strong>
          <strong>ACT OF DECEIVING</strong>
          an action that is intended to deceive, either as a way of cheating someone, or as a joke or form of entertainment.
        </li>

      </ul>

     <h3 class="meaning">Let's go..</h3>
      <p>
        As I listen to the song Wonderfall by Oasis (I really recommend listening to it when you're having a bad day or want to
        reflect, as in this case).
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, I realize that I want to help anyone who has doubts about programming or even about their career (not
        because there's something wrong with me, and I don't think I have savior syndrome... I hope), but rather I realize that
        my specialty is effectively teaching what your teachers are supposed to teach you in the classroom so that you can apply
        it. I like that, and it makes me happy to be aware of my catharsis, where I can show you that, as a human being, I have
        had successes and ups and downs in learning to be a better version of myself. So I want to ask you: Have you felt bad
        about the overwhelming advance of AI in your learning process to learn how to code?
      </p>

      <h3 class="meaning">
        If you’re feeling lost or left behind, you’re not alone.
      </h3>

      <p class="meaning"></p>

      <ul class="truths">
        <li>
          <strong>About AI. Will AI take your job?</strong>
          Not really.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI doesn’t...</strong>
          Think, understand context, or make real decisions.
          It predicts patterns and accelerates execution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Today, AI works like a power tool:</strong>
          It helps you move faster if you already know what you’re doing.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It won’t replace developers, designers, or creators.</strong>
        It will amplify them.
      </li>
      </ul>


      <p>
        I know you've heard that AI is going to take away coders' jobs, but that's not the case. Look, there's no overall
        objective for this tool as such, so much so that many companies are losing the money they've invested in research to
        exploit this tool to the fullest. Keep in mind that it's artificial intelligence because instead of providing solutions,
        it creates more problems (if you don't believe me, check out the tech news on this topic).

        If your parents or friends say to you: “Why are you studying software engineering if AI is going to do all the coding
        for existing systems?”, “Did you know that AI is going to do your job?” and my favorite so far, “And when you upload
        that system to GITHUB or make that video, are they going to pay you for it?” <i>THE TRICK</i> is to understand that AI doesn't
        know everything and that it's difficult for it to keep up with trends, just like you and me. They even tell you that it
        can make mistakes. As for the passive-aggressive well-wishes in the form of direct questions from your loved ones, don't
        react(Damn, I'm not talking about the Meta library). Sadly, they think that success is measured by money or the things you can have.
      </p>



      <p>
        You're not the only one who suffers from this (that includes me, welcome to the club). <i>THE TRICK</i> is to understand that
        not everyone can code, that logic governs everything, and that when you understand how to translate it into code after
        many sleepless hours, you can finally move on to using AI because now you know how, but the BIGGEST TRICK IS...
      </p>

    <h3 class="meaning">The Three Truths</h3>

    <ul class="truths">
      <li>
        <strong>Learn the fundamentals.</strong>
        Programming is logic before it is code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If your mind is not well, nothing will work.</strong>
        Mental health is part of the craft.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The magic is not money.</strong>
        It’s what you build with what you know.
      </li>
    </ul>
